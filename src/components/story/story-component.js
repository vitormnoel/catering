                Listening, talking and making crazy good food
              </span>
              <br />
              Soon after the calendar turned on Y2K and the world breathed a
              sigh of relief, Ron Helmer was operating a small café in the heart
              of Surrey. Indeed, he loved seeing people's eyes light up when
              they tasted his food and he loved the conversations and
              connections he was having with customers who soon became regulars.
              <br />
              <br />
              But, there was a recurring theme. At the same time, business
              people, administrators and educators kept asking him, “Do you do
              catering? Can you deliver food to my office or meeting room?”
            </p>
            <p>
              <span className="font-header text-xl text-blue-logo">
                Yes, he could do that. But.…
              </span>
              <br />
              Ron subsequently realized that cooking food for a single person
              and putting it in front of the customer within five minutes was
              one thing. However, cooking food for 10 or 20 or 100 and putting
              it in front of them 30 or 60 minutes later was significantly
              different.

              <br />
              Meanwhile in Vancouver, Paul Coleman was taking a step back from a
              successful career in restaurant management. Like Ron, he had been
              hearing a growing demand for catering and realized that most
              restaurants and cafés without a doubt did not have the recipes,
              supplies, expertise or equipment to consistently cater quality
              food.
              <br />
              <br />
              In two different cities as two different companies, Ron and Paul
              embraced the challenge. Individually, they quickly developed the
              expertise and tools to deliver crazygoodfood to the growing list
              of businesses, institutions and organizations that were asking for
              catering services.

              ordering. We've maintained kitchens in Vancouver and Surrey to

              we still believe in the value of answering the telephone and the
              value of working with people. Our clients are not just companies,
              email addresses, food consumers or even just clients. They are
              people and we will always treat them that way.
